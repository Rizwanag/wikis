###Introduction
The Java Persistence API is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, & managing data between Java Objects/Classes and relational database.Defined as a part of EJB 3.0. JPA is considered the standard industry approach for ORM like Hibernate, Spring Data etc.

* JPA is specification .i.e it tells any ORM what interfaces to expose to application developers
* JPA is just a specification & not a product, it cannot perform persistence or anything else by itself.
* JPA is just a set of interfaces, and requires implementation. There are open-souce & commercial JPA implementation to choose from.
* JPA needs database to persist data.
